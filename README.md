# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of the project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of the 12 "green stocks" that they were thinking of investing in. We compared the perforance of the stocks during 2017 and 2018. We have rewritten the code for this challenge to increase the efficency.

## Results

### Analysis
After refactoring the code, we were able to achieve a faster run time. The results remained the same which shows the refactored code was written correctly. The results of the code showed that most stocks performed well in 2017, but took a dip in 2018. The only stocks that saw an increase in Return for both years were ENPH and RUN. 

## Summary

### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
A couple advantages to refactoring our code are, faster run times, ease of reading, and overall cleaner code. It's even more beneficial as the dataset gets larger. A couple of disadvantages I can think of are, an issue or error in the refactored code causing the code to not run properly and it can be a unneeded work when a deadline looms or there is not much data to run through.

### Advantages of Refactoring Our VBA Code
The benefit we saw by refactoring the code, was the decrease in run time. The original code ran in just over half of a second, while our refactored code (per the images) ran in under 0.1 seconds.
