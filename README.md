# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of the project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of the 12 "green stocks" that they were thinking of investing in. We compared the perforance of the stocks during 2017 and 2018. We have rewritten the code for this challenge to increase the efficency.

## Results

### Analysis
After refactoring the code, we were able to achieve a faster run time. The results remained the same which shows the refactored code was written correctly. The results of the code showed that most stocks performed well in 2017, but took a dip in 2018. The only stocks that saw an increase in Return for both years were ENPH and RUN.
